# Double_Elimination_Tournament_2017
Created by Cristi Paduraru in 2017 as bachelor's degree project.
The scope was to have an application that can ease the hosting process of a tournament with double elimination format by providing an easy to use interface that automatically groups the participants in winners/losers bracket on the duration of the tournament. Also, the tournament results and players are saved in a local SQL database in order to provide a player database that can be reused in future tournaments.
